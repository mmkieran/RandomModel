# RandomModel

The goal of this project was to create an algorithm that would generate a random ore body deposit in a 3D space. 

There are two implementations of it, one written in C++ and one written in Python. 

The output of each is a CSV file that can be loaded into any general mine planning software (e.g. Vulcan or MineSight).
